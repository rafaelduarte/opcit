A bibliography manager with either sqlite or postgres backend.

The goal of opcit is to provide a multi-user application for managing references and bibliographies. Still in the very early phases, but can:

**python and qt based GUI** add new, edit, and delete references.
**using the bibutils suite can import and export from a wide variety of formats (bibtex, ISI, etc.)** primitive import of PubMed records
**primitive ability to format OpenOffice documents**

See the wiki (look at tabs above) for installation details.
